# How to contribute to this project

This is an open documentation project and we welcome all contributions.

## Contributor Agreement

By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under the license that this project uses. In return, you will be recognized as a contributor to this project, which will be reflected in the [authors](authors.md) document in this repo. We expect all 
contributors to abide by the project’s code of conduct. 

## How to contribute

The easiest way to get started is to file an issue to tell us about a spelling mistake, some awkward wording, or a factual error.
If you do not have a GitHub account, you can send us comments by email. However, we will be able to respond more quickly if you 
use one of the other methods described below.
If you have a GitHub account, or are willing to create one, but do not know how to use Git, you can report problems or suggest improvements by creating an issue. This allows us to assign the item to someone and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.
If you are comfortable with Git, and would like to add or change material, you can submit a pull request (PR). Instructions for doing this are included below.

All protocols are stored in `docs/_posts`. You can make a copy of the [template](docs/_posts/_template.md), save it using the filename convention (`YYYY-MM-DD-tag.md`) and add your content below the template content. Content should be in markdown format.

## What to contribute

Many different things can be contributed, you can send us an email about relevant reports, you can submit an issue informing us about an error you found, or you can submit a pull request contributing text on a new method or a procedure. 

If you would like to contribute, and don’t know quite where to start or what to do, please check the list of current issues for the repository. 

## Using Github

If you choose to contribute via GitHub, you may want to look at How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub. 
The current version of this resource is to be found in the master branch. This branch stays static until we decide that we have a new release. All development happens on the **dev-branch**. If you want to contribute, we request that you work on that one.  

How to proceed:
  * Fork (i.e. copy) the project to your account
  * Go to your fork, and change the branch of the project to the current development branch 
  * Then add/modify the contents you want. This can be done directly in your fork on github
  * Commit the change
  * Send your pull request
  * Your pull request will be merged dev-branch after manual checking
  * The admins will then rebuild the dev-branch
  * The dev-branch will be merged to master repository with the next release
